## **1. Abstract**

This project presents the design and implementation of an ESP32-based home automation system that enables wireless control of household appliances through a mobile application. The system integrates multiple sensors including DHT11 (temperature/humidity), moisture sensor, LDR (light-dependent resistor), and MQ-2 (gas sensor) to provide intelligent automation capabilities. 

The mobile application, developed using Flutter framework, communicates with the ESP32 microcontroller via WiFi to control devices such as lights, fans, water pumps, and humidifiers. The system features both manual control and automatic sensor-based operation modes, making it suitable for modern smart home applications.

**Key Features:**
